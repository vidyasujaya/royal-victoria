          an open letter
        </a>{" "}
        insisting that the site should not be privatized but used to serve the
        common good: health services, social housing, education, social
        services, community spaces, the social economy, non-profit
        organizations, etc. In the letter, we stress that the eventual use of
        the site must be in accordance with the wishes recorded in the original
        founders' deeds -- the site must always be used for healing. We further
        argue that its future must be decided, owned, and managed democratically
        and ecologically. We invite organizations to sign our open letter, which
        will be circulated to the media during the summer months. Please contact
        us to sign the letter: ccmp.miltonparc@gmail.com.

      <h3>Our March</h3>
      <p>
        We organized a march on September 4th of a hundred people. We marched
        from outside the hospital, to Parc Lucia Kowaluk (named after the Milton
        Parc community activist and social worker), and then along Pine Avenue,
        past Hôtel-Dieu Hospital (another decommissioned hospital with an
        uncertain future, that the Communauté Saint Urbain is advocating
        community uses for), the Chest Hospital (recently sold off to condo
        developers), and up until the Institut des Sourdes-Muettes (another
        decommissioned hospital where community uses are being proposed)

      <h3>Our Community Feasibility Study</h3>
      <p>
        The Our Royal Vic. Here’s what we can do with it will be a grassroots
        initiative in community planning of the site to meaningfully involve
        citizens and community organisations (especially signatories of the Open
        Letter). This project will be done in collaboration with the
        Community-University Research Exchange (CURE), and will be an
        alternative to the hierarchical approach of government institutions like
        the Société québécoise des infrastructures (SQI).
      </p>
      <p>
        It will aim to explore the feasibility of democratic management and
        social uses as expressed in the Coalition’s open letter (publicly or
        community-run healthcare, housing, social services, arts and culture,
        education, ecology) of the whole or part of the site and how such
        projects could concretely operate in terms of ownership, management,
        financing, etc. The project will focus on the Women’s and Ross pavilions
        of the site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, we will be organizing walking tours and co-design planning
        workshops with community organisations and citizens about how the site
        could be used to serve social needs. If you would like to get involved
        or at least to be kept informed, please contact us!

        We have already started community consultation by COMMUNITY
        CONSULTATION: We organized a virtual consultation session with 40
        members of our community, who insisted on the need for social housing,
        community spaces, healthcare, democratic businesses, and democratic and
        ecological planning.{" "}
