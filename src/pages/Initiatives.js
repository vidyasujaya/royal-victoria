      <h5>Our March</h5>
      <p>
        On September 4, 2020 the Royal Vic for the Public Coalition organized a
        community march. There were families, speeches, politicians, media, and
        even a choir! We marched from the Royal Victoria Hospital to Parc Lucia
        Kowaluk (named after the Milton Parc community activist and social
        worker) where we gathered for speeches.
      </p>
      <p>
        After speeches were given, the march continued past Hôtel-Dieu Hospital
        (another decommissioned hospital with an uncertain future,{" "}

        ), the Chest Hospital (recently sold off to condo developers), and
        concluded at the Institut des Sourdes-Muettes (yet another
        decommissioned hospital{" "}

        ).

      <h5>Our Consultation and Research</h5>
      <p>
        <i>The Royal Vic is ours: Here’s what we can do with it</i> feasibility
        study will be a grassroots initiative with the goal of meaningfully
        involving citizens and community organisations in planning future uses
        of the site. This project will be done in collaboration with the
        Community-University Research Exchange (
        <u>
          <a href="http://www.curemontreal.org/">CURE</a>
        </u>
        ), distinguished from the Société québécoise des infrastructures (SQI)
        in its emphasis on citizen-led consultation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CURE study will aim to explore the feasibility of democratic
        management and social uses as expressed in the Coalition’s open letter
        (publicly or community-run healthcare, housing, social services, arts
        and culture, education, ecology), and how such projects could concretely
        operate in terms of ownership, management, financing, etc. The project
        will focus on the Women’s, Ross, and Hersey pavilions of the site.
      </p>

        We have already organized two virtual community consultation sessions
