        insisting that the site should not be privatized but used to serve the
        common good: health services, social housing, education, social
        services, community spaces, the social economy, non-profit
        organizations, etc. In the letter, we stress that the eventual use of
        the site must be in accordance with the wishes recorded in the original
        founders' deeds -- the site must always be used for healing. We further
        argue that its future must be decided, owned, and managed democratically
        and ecologically. We invite organizations to sign our open letter, which
        will be circulated to the media during the summer months. Please contact
        us to sign the letter: ccmp.miltonparc@gmail.com.
