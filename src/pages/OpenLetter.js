      <hr />
      <p>
        After our march on September 4th, we published an open letter (LINK) in
        the media with our Coalition’s position:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>opposing privatization</li>
          <li>maintaining the site’s use for community-type of functions;</li>
          <li>
            demanding transparent decision-making process that involve civil
            society;
          </li>
          <li>
            respecting the Royal Victoria’s founding mission by preserving its
            legacy of healing;
          </li>
          <li>favouring an ecological approach in the site’s development.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
