      <h5>The Situation and What is Happening with the Hospital</h5>
      <hr />
      <p>
        In 2015, health services moved out of the Royal-Victoria Hospital in
        2015 and into the new super-hospital at the Glen. Three years later, in
        2018, the Quebec government announced authorization of McGill University
        to explore using half of the pavilions (pavilions L, M, S, A, and E) to
        develop a new campus by 2027, and granted McGill $37m to fund a
        feasibility study. They also mandated the Société Québécoise des
        Infrastructures (SQI), the provincial agency that manages provincially
        owned property, to do a master plan for the whole site and to propose
        different uses (including for the pavilions not proposed as a McGill
        campus, H, R, F, C, X, and eventually the Allen Memorial Institute).
        These proposals will go to the Conseil du Trésor of the provincial
        government who will ultimately make decisions about the future of the
        site.

        So what does this mean for us? McGill University will probably
        eventually acquire half of the pavilions for a campus. We are not
        opposed to McGill using part of the site for a campus, as long as the
        ownership remains in the public domain and is safeguarded from any
        privatization.

        Regarding the other half of the pavilions, their future is uncertain.
        Although the original founders of the hospital wisely included in the
        deed of transfer that the site must always be used for healing, there is
        no guarantee that this is still legally binding and none of the
        principles directing the SQI’s planning process prioritize social uses
        of the site. The SQI’s planning process does have a participatory
        element, including consultative meetings with stakeholder groups and
        guided visits of the site, although it is not truly a public
        consultation (the Office de consultation publique de Montréal will do a
        consultation in 2021). There is also an openness for transitory
        occupations of the site, to test out different uses for the site as part
        of a process of developing permanent uses. This could be an opportunity
        for the population and community organizations to propose innovative
        social uses of different pavilions. But we also have to be careful of
        attempts to privatize the site such as for condos, private healthcare or
        elderly care, bars, restaurants, and hotels.
