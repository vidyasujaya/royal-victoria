      <h3>Our Coalition</h3>
      <h5>We are the Royal Vic for the Public Coalition</h5>
      <hr />
      <p>
        The Royal Vic for the Public Coalition is a Montreal-wide coalition to
        advocate for the hospital to always be devoted to the common good, in
        accordance with the wishes recorded in the original founders' deeds. The
        site of the former Royal Victoria Hospital must remain in the public
        domain, be managed democratically and ecologically, and be used to serve
        urgent needs in our communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        We oppose any attempt to privatize the site, as has happened to many
        other hospitals, and major institutional and ecclesiastical sites close
        to the mountain, like the Children’s Hospital, the Chest Hospital,
        Marianopolis College, the Couvent d’Outremont, the Missionary Sisters of
        the Immaculate Conception, and the Shriners Hospital. Other enormous
        publicly-owned sites that have been sold off for private developers are
        the Radio-Canada site and the Peel-Bonaventure Basin site.
      </p>
      <p>
        The founding members of the Coalition are the Milton Parc Citizens’
        Committee, the Peter McGill Community Council, the Students’ Society of
        McGill University, the Yellow Door, and the Communauté Milton Parc.
