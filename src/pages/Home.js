      <p>
        The Royal Vic for the Public Coalition is a community coalition that
        advocates for the site of the former Royal Victoria Hospital to always
        serve the common good, in accordance with the wishes recorded in the
        original founders' deeds. We want it to remain in the public domain, be
        managed democratically and ecologically, and be used to serve urgent
        needs through uses such as: healthcare, social services, cooperative and
        non-profit housing, community organizations, education, art and culture,
        and the social economy. We oppose any attempt to privatize the site, as
        has happened to other hospitals like the Children’s Hospital and the
        Chest Hospital.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        The founding members of the Coalition are the Milton Parc Citizens’
        Committee, the Peter McGill Community Council, the Students’ Society of
        McGill University, the Yellow Door, and the Communauté Milton Parc.
