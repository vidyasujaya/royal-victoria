      <h5>September 4 Community March</h5>
      <hr />
      <p>
        On September 4, 2020 the Royal Vic for the Public Coalition organized a
        community march. There were families, speeches, politicians, media, and
        even a choir! We marched from outside the hospital to Parc Lucia Kowaluk
        (named after the Milton Parc community activist and social worker),
        where we then gathered for speeches. The march then continued along
        Avenue des Pins, past Hôtel-Dieu Hospital (another decommissioned
        hospital with an uncertain future, where community uses are being
        proposed), the Chest Hospital (recently sold off to condo developers),
        and concluded at the Institut des Sourdes-Muettes (another
        decommissioned hospital where community uses are being proposed).
