      <h3>Our Research and Community Feasibility Study</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        The Our Royal Vic: Here’s what we can do with it feasibility study will
        be a grassroots initiative with the goal of meaningfully involving
        citizens and community organisations in planning future uses of the site
        (especially signatories of our Open Letter). This project will be done
        in collaboration with the Community-University Research Exchange (CURE)
        as an alternative to the hierarchical approach of government
        institutions like the Société québécoise des infrastructures (SQI).{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        The CURE study will aim to explore the feasibility of democratic
        management and social uses as expressed in the Coalition’s open letter
        (publicly or community-run healthcare, housing, social services, arts
        and culture, education, ecology), and how such projects could concretely
        operate in terms of ownership, management, financing, etc. The project
        will focus on the Women’s, Ross, and Hersey pavilions of the site.{" "}

        We have already organized two virtual community consultation sessions
        with citizens and organizations in Milton Parc and downtown (Peter
        McGill) neighbourhoods (click the links to watch the videos recordings).
        Soon, we will be organizing walking tours and co-design planning
        workshops with community organisations and citizens. If you would like
        to get involved or be kept informed, please contact us!{" "}
